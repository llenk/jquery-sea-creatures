## vim notes
Vim is the Hotel California of text editors. First, click 'a' or 'i' to insert. Type your thing, then type colon-w-q to write/quit. 

## git notes
Think of your commit messages as starting "this will"
 * git remote add origin URL
 The "origin" there is a variable name for the url, so it could totally be "taco" or something. 
 ```
 git push --set-upstream origin master
 ```
 This will set an upstream version that connects it.

 ## terminal notes
